In the tenth part of the course we introduce handling collections with streams. You'll learn how to create a stream from a collection, filter the values of a stream, transform the values of a stream, and collect values of a stream to another collection. We introduce the concept lambda expression, and you'll learn to use it in your programs. You will also learn how to order objects using the Java Comparable interface, and some other useful techniques like regular expressions, enumerate type and iterator.
